# Simple Data Pipleine with SQLAlchemy

In this demo, I will show you how to create a simple data pipeline that moves data from a CSV file into a relational database like SQLite or PostgreSQL.

For this task, we will use the SQLAlchemy library. This library makes it easy to create database tables using Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) features. It also helps us interact with the database in a straightforward way.

To follow this demo , you need to do these steps first.
- Clone this repo.
- Setup virtual environment as your own by using `python -m venv environment`. Don't change the virtual environment name.
- Activate your environment.
- Install the required libraries by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
